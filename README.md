## A text-based console game - Tic-Tac-Toe - :x: vs. :o:
I created a text-based console game: **Tic-Tac-Toe**, 
<br>also known as Noughts and Crosses or Xs and Os, in Python.

Play the timeless game of Tic-Tac-Toe with friends and family. 

This **Python-based** implementation allows you to challenge your friends 
<br>and test your wits against each other. 

Enjoy hours of fun and strategic thinking!

## What game have I created? :technologist:
In this game, **two players** are involved.

- At the beginning of the game, they choose their player **names** and player **symbols**.

- They can then choose to play either a **classic 3x3 game grid** or create a custom one.

- After the duel ends, a **winner** is determined, or it may result in a **draw**.

- All **statistics** are displayed.

- Players can **then** choose to start a next duel, a new game with new player names and symbols, save their game progress, or end the entire game. 

- Players can later **load their saved games** and continue playing with their names, symbols, and total wins intact.

Essentially, the game can be played indefinitely.
